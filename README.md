- `gpt2_shakespeare.R`: Here I provide code in R `torch` to train a GPT2 model to predict Shakespeare quotes (based on https://mlverse.github.io/luz/articles/examples/chargpt.html).

- `ndvi_forecast.ipynb`: Here I provide code in Python using `PyTorch` to train a very simple transformer-based neural network to forecast NDVI values for a coordinate located in Bonn, Germany. The code to obtain the data is in `ndvi_data_download.R`.
